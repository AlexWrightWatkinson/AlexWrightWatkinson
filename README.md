### About me

I'm Alex! An embedded software engineer who enjoys performance profiling and optimizations.
My work spans:

- C/C++ on Linux and Bare-metal systems
- Optimised data pipelines (SIMD, multithreading, cache-aware code)
- SPI/I2C/GPIO protocol integration
- Linux tooling, build systems, and performance instrumentation


### Technical Focus

- **languages:** C, C++, Python, Bash, x86/ARM assembly
- **Systems and tooling:** Linux, GDB, perf, valgrind/cachegrind, llvm-mca, flamegraphs, Make/CMake, Docker

### Highlighted Projects

### **RTOS Simulator** 
A preemptive scheduler simulator built with `ucontext` + `SIGALRM`, modelling priority-based RTOS behaviour.  
**Features:** context switching, mutexes, periodic tasks, cooperative/preemptive switching.

**Repo:** https://github.com/AlexWrightWatkinson/RTOS-Simulator

### **Persistence of Vision Display (MEng Project)**
A 1-metre dynamically-addressed POV display: wirelessly powered, video-driven, and timing-critical.  
I led the Raspberry Pi subsystem (C), video decode, SIMD-backed transforms, and custom SPI streaming protocol. Handling both image and video up to 30 FPS.

### What I'm Working On

- A series of **Embedded Linux mini-projects** (device drivers, kernel interfaces, schedulers)  
- Performance engineering deep dives (SIMD, CPU pipelines, benchmarks, micro-optimisation)  
- Improving my tooling mastery: `perf`, BPF, LTTng, clang-tidy/format, qemu, buildroot/Yocto basics
- Performance investigation into increasingly complex implementations of single-producer single-consumer queues
